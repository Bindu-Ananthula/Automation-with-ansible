# Automation-with-ansible-ET2598
A webservice is implemented using NGNIX web server.
Bastion Host is used as jump host.
HAproxy is used as the Load balancer.
These tasks are done by Ansible.

I have created the servers in the city cloud using the ssh key-gen and saved my keys in '~/.ssh/'.

These are the ip addresses of the servers created:
devA:10.1.0.89
devB:10.1.0.145
devC:10.1.0.36
bastionET2598:188.95.231.123
devhaproxy:91.106.193.68
